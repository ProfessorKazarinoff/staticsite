This is the first part of a multi-part series on building a web app with Python and Django. The web app will act as a resource for Engineering students at Oregon Community Colleges that want to transfer to 4-year Universities. The transfer web app will show which classes from their community college engineering program will transfer to classes in a 4-year University engineering program. In this first post, we'll review the motivation for the project and my initial idea of what the finished app will look like.

# The Oregon Engineering College Transfer Web App

What does that even mean? Students at community colleges in Oregon State, including Portland Community College, Mount Hood Community College, Linn Benton Community College, Lane Community College and Clackamas Community College can transfer to 4-year universities in Oregon state such as Portland State University, Oregon State University and Oregon Institute of Technology.

Although there is some standardization in college engineering course offerings in all the the Oregon schools, there are also a lot of differences. For example, ENGR is the course code used at Portland Community College, but ENG is the course code used at Portland State.

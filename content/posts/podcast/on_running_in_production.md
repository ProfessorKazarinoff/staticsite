If you want to see how I deployed JupyterHub for my students, see the link to the documentation I built of the process below:

I have been working on building some Ansible Playbooks to automate my JupyterHub deployments. Not ready for production, but you can see the Playbooks I've developed so far here:

Before we started recording, Nick and I chatted a bit and reviewed the Google Doc he sent me to prepare for the interview. Nick is a real pro. He made sure the audio quality was top-notch and assured me that he could edit out any trouble spots (like when I had to cough and take a drink of water during the recording). I recorded my audio hidden inside a closet in our basement surrounded by blankets. 

### A couple of notes about being a podcast guest:

 * Nick sent out a Google Doc with some talking points and how to set up audio recording with [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/download) before we recorded. It was helpful to have some talking points to jog my mind during the interview.
 * I set up to record in a closet and put my laptop on a folded towel.
 * I used a USB microphone sitting on a different bin than the laptop and a set of headphones. 
 * Nick and I chatted over Zoom before we started recording. It was great to learn more about Nick and how he got into podcasting. 
 * Nick edited the audio after we recorded. Knowing that the recording could be modified was made it easier for me to speak freely.
 * Because Running in Production episodes are edited and Nick has multiple guests lined up, the episode with me was posted a few weeks after we recorded.
 * When the episode came out, I tweeted the episode link out (I also wrote this blog post). 
 * I listened to the episode while I was on a run. And honestly, it sounded great!

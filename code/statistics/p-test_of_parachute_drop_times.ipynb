    "The data for two samples comes from the measured drop times of parachutes built as part of a group project in an introductory Engineering class. Each group needed to build a parachute and then there was a competition to determine which parachute slowed the fall of a bean bag the most. The group with the slowest parachute fall is given extra credit.\n",

    "\n",
    "Each parachute was timed by at least 4 people. The recorded drop times for parachute a and parachute b are below. The drop times were measured in seconds. The longer the time (highest number of seconds), the slower the parachute descended. \n",

We can create a list of drop times, then use Python's ```sum()``` function and ```len()``` function to compute the mean. ```sum()``` sums the values in a list, ```len()``` outputs the number of values in a list."

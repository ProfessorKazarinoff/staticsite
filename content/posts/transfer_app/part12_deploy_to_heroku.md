Summary: This is the 12th part of a multi-part series on building a web app with Python and Django. The web app will act as a resource for Engineering students at Oregon Community Colleges who want to transfer to 4-year Universities. The transfer web app will show which classes from their Community College Engineering program will transfer to which classes in a 4-year University Engineering program. In this 12th part of the series, we are going to deploy our website with Heroku so that other people can see it.

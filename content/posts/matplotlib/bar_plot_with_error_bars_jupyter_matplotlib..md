Summary: Bar charts with error bars are useful in engineering to show the confidence or precision in a set of measurements or calculated values. Bar charts without error bars give the illusion that a measured or calculated value is known to high precision or high confidence. In this post we will build a bar plot using Python and matplotlib. The plot will show the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) for three different materials based on a small data set. We will then add error bars to this chart based on the standard deviation of the data.

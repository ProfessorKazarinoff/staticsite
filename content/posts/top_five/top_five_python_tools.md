This post contains my top 5 Python tools. These 5 tools are the ones I recommend for Python programers to use. I use these tools when I write, run and revise code and they help make me a more productive programmer.

## 1. Anaconda

I use the [Anaconda](https://anaconda.com/distribution) distribution of Python. You can also install Python from [Python.org](https://python.org), but I prefer to use Anaconda. Anaconda installs in the *user space*, rather than install *system wide*. Installing in user space is important because it allows me to install Anaconda on work and school computers where I don't have administration privaleges to install software. 

Anaconda comes with the most commonly used Python packages for Engineers and includes the Anaconda prompt. If you want a smaller install (Anaconda is a pretty big download), you can install Miniconda instead. Miniconda comes with just the Anaconda Prompt terminal and a base Python environment but no pre-installed packages. 

## 2. Jupyter Notebooks

I use Jupyter notebooks to write and run Python code. I find Jupyter notebooks useful to prototype programs and work with data and plots in a way that provides quick feedback.

## 3. Anaconda Prompt

I use the Anconda Prompt as my Windows terminal. The Windows cmd terminal is another option, but I prefer the Anaconda Prompt. You can use the Anaconda prompt to navigate the file system, create and delete files, and run terminal commands. The Anaconda Prompt starts with an active base conda environment.

## 4. Conda

[![SymPy Example]({static}/posts/top_five/images/sympy_example.PNG)](https://pythonforundergradengineers.com/sympy-expressions-and-equations.html)

I use the **conda** package manager to create virtual environments and install Python packages. **pip*, the Python package manager can also be used to install Python packages, but I prefer to use conda most of the time. Conda can install Python packages as well as non-Python packages such as javascript packages or packages like ffmpeg that are difficult to install on Windows.

## 5. VS Code

My favorite code editor right now is [VS Code](). VS Code is free to install and use. Like Anaconda, it installs in user space so you don't need administrator privaleges to use it. You can install the Python extension in VS Code to add additonal features that are useful for Python programmers. I like the way VS Code starts quickly and can be used as a basic text editor and also be used like a full-featured IDE. VS Code is the code editor I recommend for Python programmers.

My goal is to help reduce student cost and investigate how Python could be used in an engineering programming course instead of MATLAB. I earned my PhD in Material Science and Engineering from the University of Washington. Currently, I work as a Professor of Engineering and Engineering Technology at Portland Community College in Portland, OR. Teaching at a community college is my dream job.

In the last post , we used pelican-quickstart to build the framework of the site and wrote a short first post, then viewed a demo version of the site on localhost:8000. In this post we will add a custom theme to the site called pelican_bootstrap3. The pelican_bootstrap3 theme looks great and is mobile reponsive so it will make the site look good on phones and tablets. Then we'll add some custom css to personalize the look of the theme. Steps in this post We are going to accomplish the following in this post. By the end of the post we are going to have a a static site with a great looking bootstrap3 theme which is mobile responsive and looks great on desktops, tablets and phones. Activate our staticsite virtual environment Pull the most recent version of our site from github Add a git submodule to our staticsite folder and bring in the pelican-themes repo from github Add a git submodule to our staticsite folder and bring in the pelican-plugins repo from github Modify the pelicanconf.py file to point to our new theme, and add a new plugin Build and preview the site with Pelican Add and commit the changes then push those changes to github Big steps, it's really going to look like a website when we are done. Activate our virtual environment and pull from github Open the Anaconda Prompt and activate the (staticsite) virtual environment $ source activate staticsite Then cd into the staticsite directory and bring in the most up to date version of the site stored on github. (staticsite) $ cd ~ (staticsite) $ cd Documents/staticsite (staticsite) $ git pull origin master Use git submodule add to pull all of the themes into our local staticsite/pelican-themes directory There are a bunch of different themes available for static site built with pelican. The three I was most interested in were: material voidy_bootstrap pelican-bootstrap3 We can bring in all of the Pelican themes stored on github by creating a git submodule . A git submodule is a sub-repository within a git repository that is linked to another repository. It is a way to bring in something else from github within a local repository and not have to keep a local copy up to date. Each time we \"pull\" from the submodule, we get the newest version of the pelican-themes repo on github. We don't have to manually track any changes to these themes and incorporate them to our local version. When the changes are made to the themes on github, we just pull those changes down to our local version. The lines git submodule init and git submodule update --init --recursive are important to call. If those two commands are not moved we'll end up with empty folders within the staticsite/pelican-themes directory. A lot of the themes are submodules themselves so the --recursive option has to be used to pull all of these submodules down. Without --recursive you can end up with empty folders. To create the folder for our pelican-themes git submodule, ensure you are in the staticsite folder, then call: $ pwd $ git submodule add https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-themes.git $ git submodule init $ git submodule update --init --recursive Ensure that we are still in the staticsite directory and pull down the pelican-plugins repo form github. $ pwd $ git submodule add https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-plugins.git $ git submodule init $ git submodule update --init --recursive Now the contents of the staticsite folder should look something like: staticsite/ ├── LICENSE ├── Makefile ├── README.md ├── __pycache__ ├── content ├── develop_server.sh ├── fabfile.py ├── output ├── pelican-plugins ├── pelican-themes ├── pelican.pid ├── pelicanconf.py ├── publishconf.py └── srv.pid Modify the pelicanconf.py file, so that we can use a new theme. So far our pelicanconf.py file contains only default lines of code that Pelican built for us. In order to use a new theme, we need to edit this configuration file. After we edit the configuration file, the make html command will produce new .html pages in the output directory. The relevant lines to add and modify in the pelicanconf.py are: #pelicanconf.py PLUGIN_PATHS = ['pelican-plugins'] THEME = 'pelican-themes/pelican-bootstrap3' BOOTSTRAP_THEME = 'flatly' PLUGIN_PATHS = ['/path/to/git/pelican-plugins'] JINJA_ENVIRONMENT = {'extensions': ['jinja2.ext.i18n']} PLUGINS = [ 'i18n_subsites'] I18N_TEMPLATES_LANG = 'en' Taken directly from the pelicin-bootstrap3 README.md ... this template can be translated (see Translations below). You also need to activate a plugin that initializes the i18n jinja extension. One possibility is an up to date version of the i18n_subsites plugin So we need to make sure to include the i18n plugin in our pelicanonf.py file. Again from the from the pelicin-bootstrap3 README.md If you are using i18n_subsites and you are not using English as your default language, make sure to also correctly specify the default language of the theme. Otherwise the translations will not be used on your default site. Build and preview the site with Pelican With the pelican-plugins and pelican-themes repos downloaded and the pelicanconf.py file editied, we can build the site and take a look at it with a web browser: make html make serve To view the site, point a brower to localhost:8000 localhost:8000 Now, the site should look something like this: Add and commit the changes then push those changes to github When we are done editing the the site, we add all of the changes to our local git repo using git add . . Then we commit those changes with git commit and add the -m \"added pelican_bootstrap3 theme\" flag to give supply a commit message (make sure to use double quotes \"commit message\"). To push those changes up to github use git push origin master git add . git commit -m \"added pelican_bootstrap3 theme\" git push origin master In the next post we will add some additional pelican-plugins to bring extra functionality to the site and add the ability to include jupyter notebooks in posts.","tags":"This site","url":"how-i-built-this-site-3.html"},{"title":"How I build this site - Part 2","text":"This is the second part in a multi-part series on how I built this site. In the last post , we set up our development environment including Python, a new virtual environment, installed the pelican and markdown packages and set up git. In this post, we will use the pelican-quickstart command to get the blog off the ground. We are also going to create a first_post.md file and serve up the website locally so we can take a look at it. Steps in this post We are going to accomplish the following in this post. By the end of the post, we will have a working website with one blog post served up locally and an updated github repo with all the changes saved. Activate our staticsite virtual environment Pull the most recent version of our site from github Use the pelican-quickstart command to make a first version of the site Write a first post in markup language (.md) Build the site using the make html command Serve the site locally using make serve and view with a web browser Add and commit the changes then push those changes to github That's a lot to do, so let's get started. Activate our staticsite virtual environment I highly recommend installing the Anaconda distribution of python. If you followed along with the previous post , you already installed Anaconda and can pull up the Anaconda prompt. Open the Anaconda Prompt and see which virtual environments are available. $ conda info --envs You should see a list of all the virtual environments conda has created on your machine. It should look something like: staticsite C:\\Users\\user.name\\AppData\\Local\\Continuum\\Anaconda3\\envs\\staticsite root * C:\\Users\\user.name\\AppData\\Local\\Continuum\\Anaconda3 The staticsite virtual environment is the one we set up to create our site. Activate it with: $ source activate staticsite You should now see (staticsite) before the command prompt. This means we are operating in the staticsite virtual environment. View installed packages We installed pelican, markdown and fabric in the last post. Let's make sure they are installed in our (staticsite) virtual environment. (staticsite)$ pip freeze Make sure you see the following modules are installed: beautifulsoup4==4.6.0 Jinja2==2.9.6 Fabric==1.14.0 Markdown==2.6.9 pelican==3.7.1 Pygments==2.2.0 Pelican Quickstart - make the site! We are now going to build the site! Exciting stuff. With the virtual environment and packages in place, we just need to make sure we are in a directory where we want our site to live. (staticsite)$ cd ~ (staticsite)$ cd Documents (staticsite)$ cd staticsite You can confirm you are working in the staticsite directory by typing pwd which stands for print working directory : (staticsite)$ pwd Now we can spin up the settings and structure of our pelican build. Start the process with the command: (staticsite)$ pelican-quickstart Pelican will ask us a bunch of questions at the start. The initial settings I used are below. Make sure to change the title, author, URL prefix, and timezone: > Where do you want to create your new web site? [.] > What will be the title of this web site? Python Programming for Undergraduate Engineers > Who will be the author of this web site? Peter D. Kazarinoff > What will be the default language of this web site? [English] > Do you want to specify a URL prefix? e.g., http://example.com (Y/n) Y > What is your URL prefix? (see above example; no trailing slash) https://username.github.io/staticsite > Do you want to enable article pagination? (Y/n) Y > How many articles per page do you want? [10] 5 > What is your time zone? [Europe/Paris] America/Los_Angeles > Do you want to generate a Fabfile/Makefile to automate generation and publishing? (Y/n) Y > Do you want an auto-reload & simpleHTTP script to assist with theme and site development? (Y/n) Y > Do you want to upload your website using FTP?

(y/N) N Now we can create and view the site. The command make html will create the site and the command make serve will spin up a local webserver that allows us to view the site. (staticsite)$ make html (staticsite)$ make serve Point a web browser to: localhost:8000 The site will look something like: We can shut down the server by typing ctrl-c Write a first post in markup language (.md) Time to write our first post. The contents of the staticsite directory should look something like: staticsite/ │ develop_server.sh │ fabfile.py │ Makefile │ pelicanconf.py │ publishconf.py │ ├───content ├───output └───__pycache__ To make a new post, we need to add a markup file (.md file) to the content folder. Let's call our first post first_post.md . Depending on the computer I'm using, I create .md files with different programs. One Windows 10, I have been using Code Writer. On Mac OSX and Linux, I use PyCharm . The first_post.md file saved in the content folder needs to have the form: Title : First Post Date : 2017 - 10 - 13 12 : 40 Modified : 2017 - 10 - 13 12 : 40 Status : published Category : This site Tags : python , markdown , blog Slug : first - post Authors : Peter D . Kazarinoff Summary : This is the summary of the first post This is the very first post ! After saving the file first_post.md in the content folder, the static site folder should look something like: staticsite/ │ develop_server.sh │ fabfile.py │ Makefile │ pelicanconf.py │ publishconf.py │ ├───content │ first_post.md │ ├───output └───__pycache__ Let's build the site again and take a look at our new post (staticsite)$ make html (staticsite)$ make serve Again, point a web browser to: localhost:8000 The site will look something like: It works! I can see the first post! We can shut down the server by typing ctrl-c Add and commit the changes then push the changes to github When we are done editing the posts and the site, we add all of the changes to our local git repo using git add . Then we commit these changes with git commit and use the -m \"created pelcian static site\" flag to supply a commit message (make sure to use double quotes \"commit message\"). Push those changes up to github with git push origin master git add . git commit -m \"created pelican static site\" git push origin master In the next post , we will customize the site with a pelican-theme called pelican-bootstrap3 .","tags":"This site","url":"how-i-built-this-site-2.html"},{"title":"How I build this site - Part 1","text":"This is the first part of a multi-part series on how I built this site. In this first post, we'll review the development environment, installing Python, virtual environments, installing the necessary packages and setting up git. Setting up the development environment What does that even mean? Before I started building this site I needed to make sure the necessary software, packages and settings were in place. This starts with setting up a development environment . To me, a development environment is simply the software on a computer that allows me to get work done. In this case the development environment means the tools necessary to build this site. A list of the tools and technologies are below: An operating system: This website was built on machines running Windows 10, Mac OSX and Linux (Ubuntu 16.04 LTS). Python: Python 3.6 (legacy Python is version 2.7) Anaconda: The Anaconda Prompt and the Anaconda Python distribution Github.com and git: Four different computers were used build the site. Github is the central place where the most up to date version of the site is kept. Pelican: A static site generator written in Python. Pelican will build the site from a settings file (pelicanconf.py) and posts written in markdown (.md files) Markdown: the posts on this website are written in markdown, or .md format fabric and make: fabric is a python package to automate builds and tasks. Fabric works on Windows. Make is used on MacOSX and Linux to build the site and serve up a demo version of the site. Installing Python (the Anaconda distribution) I highly recommend installing the Anaconda distribution of Python. I have the Anaconda distribution installed on all the computers I used to build this site: Windows 10 Desktop at work Mac OSX laptop at work Mac OSX laptop at home Linux (Ubuntu 16.04 LTS) Desktop at home. An advantage of using the Anaconda distribution of Python is that each of these four computers will have the same stable version of Python. Download the latest release at: https://www.anaconda.com/download The Anaconda distribution of Python comes with an up to date and stable version of Python (Python 3.6) and the Anaconda Prompt . The Anaconda Prompt is useful because it allows me to run shell commands on my Windows 10 machine at work. These are the same commands I would run in the terminal on my Mac OSX or Linux boxes. The Anaconda Prompt makes creating and logging into virtual environments easy and allows me to use git on Windows 10. Follow this post to install the Anaconda on Windows 10. Create a new virtual environment Before downloading Pelican, we should create a new virtual environment. The same virtual environment on each of the computers I use means the same packages are installed on each computer. To create a new virtual environment, open up the Anaconda Prompt (on Windows) or a terminal (on Linux or Mac OSX). Let's call our new virtual environment staticsite . The conda create command creates the environment and the -n staticsite flag adds the name. $ conda create -n staticsite This creates a new virtual environment called staticsite . Becuase I use four different computers to work on the site, I need to make sure the same Python packages are installed on each computer. Using a virtual environment ensures this consistency. Once the virtual environment staticsite is created, we need to activate it and start using it with the command: $ source activate staticsite We should now see (staticsite) before the terminal prompt. This means we are using the (staticsite) virtual environment. Install Pelican Time for some fun! Installing Pelican. Pelican is a Python package that creates static websites. Static sites are websites that only have html, css and javascript. A static site is not connected to a database and there is no code run on the server side. The server just serves static files (html, css, javascript) to the client when the client requests them. In order to install Pelican, we need to install pip first. (staticsite)$ conda install pip Once pip is installed, we can install pelican and markdown . These are two of the core pieces we need to build the website. fabric3 is also installed because we'll use it to build and demo the site on Windows. (staticsite)$ pip install pelican (staticsite)$ pip install markdown (staticsite)$ pip install fabric3 Create a github account and create a new repository While I was making the site, it became clear that I had to keep track of version control . I would make some changes to the site on my computer at work, then come home and make more changes to the site. Bringing a USB thumb drive back and forth was hard. I would forget the thumb drive at work or home and then could not edit the site. Or worse, I'd edit the site in both places and try to remember which changes were made where and which was the best version. Ah! The solution is to use git and github . Git is a command line utility that assists with version control. Using git means changes made to files on one computer can be synced with the same files on another computer. Github.com is the where the site content and settings are remotely stored and integrates easily with git. To sign up for a github.com account go here: https://github.com/join The account activation screen looks something like: Once the account is set up, log in and create a new repository. Use the + button on the upper right-hand menu: I named the new repository: staticsite and included both a README.md and a GNU General Public License v3.0 . Make a directory for the site and link it to github Once the github repo (short for repository, basically a folder with files on github.com) is set up, the last step to complete the development environment is to link the remote repo on github to the local version of the site on my computer. The local version is in a folder call staticsite in the Documents folder. The staticsite folder will contain all the files used to build the site and the output files created by Pelican that are the site. (staticsite)$ cd ~ (staticsite)$ cd Documents (staticsite)$ mkdir staticsite (staticsite)$ cd staticsite We can set up git to keep the contents of the local staticsite folder in sync with the contents of the staticsite repo on github.com. The command git init will initiate or create the local repository. The command git add origin followed by the url of our github repo links the folder to the repo on github. Note the web address ends in .git . If you are following along and want to build your own static site, make sure to change username to your github username and reponame to your github repo name. git init git remote add origin https://github.com/username/reponame.git Now for the git magic. On github.com we have a README.md file and a licence. But the local staticsite folder on the computer is empty. So the two folders aren't in sync. To make the contents of each folder identical, we pull the files from github onto the local computer. A pull \"pulls\" or gets the files from github and copies them to the local staticsite folder. (staticsite)$ git pull origin master If you look in the local staticsite folder you should now see the following two files: staticsite ├── LICENSE ├── README.md The development environment is set! On to building the site! Now each time I work on the site, I navigate to the staticsite folder on whatever computer I am using. Before any editing, I key in the command: git pull origin master The after the pull the staticsite folder is up to date with the newest version of all the files on github. Then I go about editing files, writing posts, changing settings, etc. After the edits, the last thing I type before shutting down the computer for the day is: git push origin master This ensures all of my computers and the github repo contain the same version of the site. In the next post we will In this post, we will use the pelican-quickstart command to get the blog off the ground, write our first post and view a demo version of the site.","tags":"this site","url":"how-i-built-site-1.html"},{"title":"Create a new virtual environment with Conda","text":"To start a new project, it is best practice to create a new virtual environment.

To start the conda prompt on Windows, go to the Windows start button on the lower left and select Anaconda Prompt. To make the new environment we need to issue the following command at the prompt: conda create --name webscrape python=3.6 The conda create command builds the new virtual environment. The --name webscrape flag gives our new virtual environment the name webscrape . I like to name my virtual environments the same name as the project that I will use that environment for, or after the name of the package that will be used the most.

I think the Anaconda distribution of Python is the the best option for undergraduate engineers who want to use Python. Anaconda is free (although the download is large which can take time) and can be installed on school or work computers where you don't have administrator access or the ability to install new programs. Steps: Visit Anaconda.com/downloads Select Windows Download the .exe installer Open and run the .exe installer Open the Anaconda prompt and run some Python code 1. Visit the Anaconda downloads page Go to the following link: Anaconda.com/downloads The Anaconda Downloads Page will look something like this: 2. Select the Windows Select Windows where the three opperating systems are listed. 3. Download Download the Python 3.6 distribution. Python 2.7 is legacy Python. For undergraduate engineers, select the Python 3.6 version. You may be prompted to enter your email. You can still download Anaconda if you click No Thanks and don't enter your Work Email address. The download is quite large (over 500 MB) so it may take a while for the download to complete. 4. Open and run the installer Once the download completes, open and run the .exe installer At the beginning of the install you will need to click Next to confirm the installation and agree to the license At the Advanced Installation Options screen, I recommend that you do not check \"Add Anaconda to my PATH environment variable\" 5. Open the Conda prompt from the Windows start menu After the Anaconda install is complete, you can go to the Windows start menu and select the Anaconda Prompt This will open up the Anaconda prompt, which is often called the Conda prompt . Anaconda is the Python distribution and the Conda prompt is a command line tool (a program where you type in your commands instead of using a mouse). It doesn't look like much, but it is really helpful for an undergraduate engineer using Python. At the Anaconda prompt, type python . This will start the Python interperater. Note the Python version. You should see something like Python 3.6.1 . With the interperter running, you will see a set of greater-than symbols >>> before the cursor. Now you can type Python commands. Try typing import this . You should see the Zen of Python by Tim Peters To close the Python interperater, type exit() at the interperator prompt >>> . Note the double parenthesis at the end of the command. The () is needed to stop the Python interperator and get back out to the Conda Prompt. To close the Conda prompt, you can either close the window with the mouse, or type exit . Congratulations!

This book is for undergraduate engineers and problem solvers learning programming. It is focused on using Python and programming to solve engineering problems. The book is written at an introductory level for people who want to get started using Python. The book starts with what is Python and how to install Python on your computer. Then it teaches you about the Python REPL and Jupyter Notebooks. Some specific Python libraries covered later in the book are:

* NumPy - numeric computing library
* Matplotlib - 2D and 3D plotting
* SymPy - Symbolic math functions
* PySerial - Communication with external hardware
* MicroPython - Run Python on a microcontroller.

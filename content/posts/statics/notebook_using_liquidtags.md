Summary: Engineering statics problems can be solved with the help of Python and **numpy**. **Numpy** is a mathematical computation library for working with homogenous arrays. In engineering statics Forces and Momements can be represented as array. In this post we will model the forces opperating on a point as a **numpy** array and use numpy's linear algebra functions to solve for an unknown.

Summary: ![3 quiver plots]({filename}/posts/matplotlib/images/3_quiver_plots.png) A quiver plot is a type of 2D plot that shows vector lines as arrows. Quiver plots are useful in electrical engineering to visualize electrical potential and valuable in mechanical engineering to show stress gradients. In this post, we will build three quiver plots using Python, matplotlib, numpy, and Jupyter notebooks.

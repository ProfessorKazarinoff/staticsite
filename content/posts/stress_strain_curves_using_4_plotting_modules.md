Summary: After watching a great webinar about plotting with different python libraries, I wanted to see what it was like to make a stress strain curve using four different modules: pandas, matplotlib, altair and bokeh (with holoviews)

## Code pulled from a jupyter notebook using liquid tags

{% notebook ../code/tensiletest/altair_and_holoviews.ipynb %}

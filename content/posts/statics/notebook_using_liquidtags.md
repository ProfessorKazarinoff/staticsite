Summary: Engineering statics problems can be solved with the help of Python and **NumPy**. **NumPy** is a mathematical computation library for working with homogenous arrays. In engineering statics, _forces_ and _momements_ can be represented as arrays. In this post, we will model the forces opperating on a point as a **NumPy** array and use NumPy's linear algebra functions to solve for an unknown.

In this post, I am going to build a Linux PC from parts I ordered from Amazon. This is a Ryzen 5 2400G based build and will be used for general productivity tasks and building projects that require a Linux system. 

[TOC]

## Why am I building a new Linux PC?

I use a couple different computers to write this blog, write my book, and work on Python projects. Below is a partial list:

 * Windows 10 desktop at work
 * Windows 10 laptop at home
 * MacBook Air at home
 * Chromebook at home
 * Linux desktop at home

The computer that is on the fritz right now is the Linux desktop in my home office. I use this computer for writing and general Python programming. In particular I use the Linux system to build software, such as building a custom MicroPython firmware or building Python from source. It is useful to have a Linux system around for these sorts of tasks.

## Where to get Python

Python can be installed from a couple of different sources. Below are the ways to install Python that will be covered in this post:

 * Anaconda.com
 * Python.org
 * Package managers like Brew, and apt

## Install Python from Anaconda.com

I recommend undergraduate engineers install Python from [Anaconda.com](https://anaconda.com). Visit the following link:

 > [https://anaconda.com/distribution](https://anaconda.com/distribution)

Scroll down and select the most recent Python 3.x version. At the time of writing, Python 3.7 is the most recent version. Click the button to select the installer for your operating system.

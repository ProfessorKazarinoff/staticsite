Summary: **I was a guest on the [TalkPython](https://talkpython.fm) podcast with Michael Kennedy!** We talked about teaching Python at a Community College and how I moved a college engineering class from MATLAB to Python using JupyterHub. <iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/582253734&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"> </iframe>

**I was on the [TalkPython](https://talkpython.fm) podcast with Michael Kennedy!** We talked about teaching Python at a Community College and how I moved a college engineering class from MATLAB to Python. In the course I'm teaching this quarter, my students use Jupyter notebooks running on a JupyterHub server. I talked with Michael about how the JupyterHub server was set up and the advantages JupyterHub has over MATLAB.

Before we started recording, I was excited and nervous. TalkPython is a show I listen to every time a new episode is released. Michael, the host of TalkPython, is an excellent, skilled and experienced interviewer. He made the recording process clear for me as a guest. 

### A couple of notes on being a podcast guest:

 * Michael send out a Google doc with some talking points before we recorded. It was helpful to have an outline of talking points in front of me when we started recording.
 * I gave myself an hour to get ready and set up my recording stuff. Even with an hour to set up, I still called in over Skype about 5 minutes late.
 * I used a USB microphone and a set of headphones. 
 * Michael started the Skype call with some get-to-know-you chat. It was lovely to talk to him "offline" before we began recording. Our ~10-minute casual conversation calmed my nerves and helped me understand how the recording was going to work. 
 * Michael edits the audio before he posts the final podcast. Knowing that the sound could be modified was a big help. It made me worry less that I would flub a sentence.
 * Because TalkPython episodes are edited and Michael has lots of guests lined up, the episode with me was posted a couple weeks after we recorded.
 * When the episode came out, I tweeted the episode link out (I also wrote this blog post).
 * Being a guest on TalkPython was super fun! I feel honored to be on such a high-quality show with such a large following.

#### Thank-you TalkPython and Michael for helping me share my story with the Python community!

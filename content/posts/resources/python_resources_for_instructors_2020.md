This post is a list of my recommended Python teaching resources for instructors in 2020. I recieved an email from a college instructor who was thinking about moving from MATLAB to Python in one of their courses. I wanted to share my email broudly in case anyone is looking for Python resources and doesn't know where to start. If you are teaching Python in a college or highschool class, this post is for you. I've also included some resources for instructors that have experience with MATLAB, but are transitioning to Python.

## Python Instructional Resources

These resouces are for instructors teaching college of highschool classes using Python. If you are a student or general learner, they may be helpful as well.

### Python installation on Campus

We use Jupyter notebooks in our engineering programming classes to teach Python. At our college, getting Python installed on campus computers was the biggest hurdle.

On-campus, we use the Anaconda Distribution of Python [https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/). This distribution of Python can be installed in user-space (no administrator password needed on campus computers). Students can also download the Anaconda Distribution of Python for free or use our JupyterHub server online. Anaconda is useful becuase it includes the scientific packages we use in our engineering programming classes such as NumPy, Matplotlib, Pandas and Jupyter. Google now has a service called Google CoLab [https://colab.research.google.com/](https://colab.research.google.com/) that allows students to run Jupyter notebooks from within Google drive. Microsoft also has a service called Azure Notebooks [https://notebooks.azure.com/](https://notebooks.azure.com/) that also allows you to run Jupyter notebooks in the cloud. 

### Text Books

![stack of books]({static}/posts/resources/images/stack_of_books.jpg)

My book [Problem Solving with Python 3.7 Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Problem-Solving-Python-3-7-open-source/dp/1693405415) is available on Amazon. I am teaching a section of our Engineering Programming course this quarter, Winter 2020. If you would like to use the book, please feel free! I am also looking for any feedback. I'll include you in the list of contributors (with your permission) if you are interested. A free verion of the book is available at [https://problemsolvingwithpython.com/](https://problemsolvingwithpython.com/)

For my Intro to Engineering course, I constructed this book: [https://professorkazarinoff.github.io/Problem-Solving-101-with-Python/](https://professorkazarinoff.github.io/Problem-Solving-101-with-Python/). I welcome any edits. I'll add you to the list of contributors (with your permission) for any edits suggested.

### Syllabi and Lesson Plans

The syllabus and labs that we use in the ENGR114 Programming Class: [https://github.com/ProfessorKazarinoff/ENGR114](https://github.com/ProfessorKazarinoff/ENGR114). If GitHub's notebook render isn't working, you can also view the syllabus and labs on nbviwer: [Link](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ProfessorKazarinoff/ENGR114/tree/master/)

The class notes recorded during last quarter from our ENGR114 Programming Class: [https://github.com/ProfessorKazarinoff/ENGR114-2019Q4](https://github.com/ProfessorKazarinoff/ENGR114-2019Q4). Alternative nbview [Link](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ProfessorKazarinoff/ENGR114-2019Q4/tree/master/)

I found this GitHub repo for another Engineering Programing Class. This course uses NumPy and Matplotlib like we do: [https://github.com/karlvandesman/Python-Course](https://github.com/karlvandesman/Python-Course)

A set of Engineering Computations modules by Lorena Barba and Natalia Clementi. They mention they are happy to have instructors use their resources in full or partial form: [https://github.com/engineersCode/EngComp1_offtheground](https://github.com/engineersCode/EngComp1_offtheground)

## Learning Resources for Instructors

If you are instructor and learning Python programming, below are a couple resources I used to learn Python. We taught MATLAB at the college first, so I had some MATLAB experience before learning Python.

### Books

Python Data Science Handbook by Jake VanderPlas: [https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/) also on [amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Python-Data-Science-Handbook-Essential/dp/1491912057)

Effective Computation in Physics by Anthony Scopatz and Kathryn Huff: [https://www.amazon.com/Effective-Computation-Physics-Research-Python/dp/1491901535/](https://www.amazon.com/Effective-Computation-Physics-Research-Python/dp/1491901535/)

A list of free Python books was compiled by GitHub user pamoroso. This is a great list as all the books are free to read: [https://github.com/pamoroso/free-python-books#list-of-free-python-books](https://github.com/pamoroso/free-python-books#list-of-free-python-books)

### YouTube

Corey Shafer's YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYXdXT2l-Gg&list=PL-osiE80TeTskrapNbzXhwoFUiLCjGgY7
Sendex YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXBD2bB9-RA&list=PLQVvvaa0QuDeAams7fkdcwOGBpGdHpXln

### Blogs

The PyImageSearch blog by Adrian Rosebrock: [https://www.pyimagesearch.com/](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/)

Practical Business Python by Chris Moffitt: [http://pbpython.com/](http://pbpython.com/)

A running listing of Python blogs. I usually read PlanetPython a couple of times a week: [https://planetpython.org/titles_only.html](https://planetpython.org/titles_only.html)


### Podcasts

Michael Kennedy's great podcast: [https://talkpython.fm/](https://talkpython.fm/)

Michael Kennedy and Brian Okken's weekly rundown of Python news: [https://pythonbytes.fm/](https://pythonbytes.fm/)

Kelly Parades and Shawn Tibor's Teaching Python Podcast. Shawn and Kelly are both primary school teachers and share great insights for instructors: [https://www.teachingpython.fm/](https://www.teachingpython.fm/)

### MATLAB to Python

If you know MATLAB, but what to try Python in your class, below are some resources to look into.

Real Python's long blog post comparing Python and MATLAB [https://realpython.com/matlab-vs-python/](https://realpython.com/matlab-vs-python/)

SciPy (the folks that make NumPy and Matplotlib) have a docs page describing how to use NumPy if you are a MATLAB user [https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/numpy-for-matlab-users.html](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/numpy-for-matlab-users.html)

This is an older resource, but I still found it helpful: [http://mathesaurus.sourceforge.net/](http://mathesaurus.sourceforge.net/)

This GitHub repo is another place to check out the MATLAB to Python comparison:
[https://github.com/PythonForMatlabProgrammers](https://github.com/PythonForMatlabProgrammers)

## Summary

This post contained a listing of different Python resources for college or highschool instructors that I use and recommend. As an instructor, you can learn about Python in a bunch of different ways such as books, YouTube, Blogs, and Podcasts. I hope you find some of these resources useful.

This post is a short list of my recommended Python learning resources. I received an email from someone who found this blog and [my GitHub repo](https://github.com/ProfessorKazarinoff) and asked about the right place to go to start learning Python. The list of resources in this post comes from the email I sent back. I want to share these Python resources with everyone reading this blog.

## Books

My book [Problem Solving with Python 3.7 Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Problem-Solving-Python-3-7-open-source/dp/1693405415) is available on Amazon. I am teaching a section of our Engineering Programming course this quarter, Winter 2019. If you would like to use the book, please feel free! I am also looking for any feedback. I'll include you in the list of contributors (with your permission) if you are interested.

For my Intro to Engineering course, I constructed this book: [https://professorkazarinoff.github.io/Problem-Solving-101-with-Python/](https://professorkazarinoff.github.io/Problem-Solving-101-with-Python/). I welcome any edits. I'll add you to the list of contributors (with your permission) for any edits suggested. So far, one person has given me feedback. You can see how contributors are listed here: [https://professorkazarinoff.github.io/Problem-Solving-101-with-Python/99-Appendix/99.08-Contributions/](https://professorkazarinoff.github.io/Problem-Solving-101-with-Python/99-Appendix/99.08-Contributions/)

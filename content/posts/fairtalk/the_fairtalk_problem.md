Summary: What exactly is the problem that needs to be solved with Fair Talk? Where and when does the problem take place and who does it effect?

## What is The Fair?

When I talk about _The Fair_, I mean The Oregon Country Fair. The Oregon Country Fair is an annual event outside Eugene, OR that is attended by about 50,000 people each year. It is sort of like a renaissance festival, music festival and craft show all in one. The fair is in the woods in Veneta, OR just outside the city of Eugene. There are open areas connected with walking paths that are lined with booths on either side. 




## What is the Fair Talk Problem?

The problem is that with 50,000 people all crammed into a one little wooded area overwhelm the cell phone network. If you try to text or call someone inside The Fair, the text is likely to be delayed hours or a day and the voice call usually doesn't go through. Doing anything else that requires cell phone connectivity like using google maps or browsing the internet doesn't usually work either. 

## Who does the Fair Talk Problem Effect?

The inability to text or call anyone inside The Fair is a problem for our family. My mother-in-law, and two brothers-in-law stay on the fair grounds. My wife and kids stay with my father-in-law near The Fair, but off The Fair grounds. When we decide to meet somewhere in The Fair, we have to be very specific about the time and meeting place. There is no way to change plans and let people inside The Fair know with a text or call until you see them face to face again. Texting just doesn't work reliably. 

## When is Fair Talk a Problem?

The cell phone network only gets overwhelmed during The Fair. This is over the course of three days in mid-July. In the week leading up to The Fair, the cell network is still often slow.

## What are some of the Physical Constraints to the Fair Talk Problem?

There are a couple of physical constraints to the way I need to communicate with my extended family during The Fair. One is distance. It is approximately 1 mile between the campground in The Fair, and where my wife and I stay outside of The Fair. Another Physical constraint is trees. The Fair is in a forest and there are large douglas fir trees surrounding the property. These trees can be 50 feet tall and spaced very close together. Think about the kind of forest you would find bigfoot in.  Another physical constraint is power. In The Fair, there aren't regular electrical power and outlets hanging around. Charging cell phones can be a pain because there isn't anywhere to plug them in. Cell phone opperating system is another problem. Some people in the family have iphones and some have android phones.

## What are some resources available to solve the Fair Talk Problem?

There are a bunch of Physical constraints, but there are also some resources that can be used. There is power at my father-in-laws house. Regular 120V wall power. I can run a fairly long electrical cord to put that power anywhere in a 50ft radius of his shop. My father-in-law also has lots of space in his yard. There is about 5 acres of space. I don't think my father-in-law will be overly concerned with a big antenna in the lawn for three days.

Summary: Plotting stress strain curves is a useful skill in mechanical engineering because it allows us to derive mechanical properties of materials such as tensile strength, elastic modulus, yield strength and ductility. Plotting stress strain curves can be accomplished with Excel and MATLAB, but what about plotting stress strain curves with Python? Follow along to find out.

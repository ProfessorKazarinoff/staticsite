## What is GitHub Actions?

GitHub Actions are scripts or bits of code that can run automatically by GitHub every time a specific thing related to a GitHub repo takes place. Usually, an action runs when a commit is pushed up to GitHub.com, but an action could also run when an issue is filed, or a new version of a package is published. GitHub actions is an example Continous Integration (CI). The GitHub Actions docs state that GitHub Actions an be used to "build, test, package, release, or deploy any code project on GitHub"

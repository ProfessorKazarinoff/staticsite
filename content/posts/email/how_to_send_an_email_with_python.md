In this post, I'll go over how to send an email with Python. First we'll go over how to send one email, then we'll set up a server to send emails on a schedule. By the end of the post, you'll learn how to automate sending reminder emails to a group of people.

## Why send email with Python

Why send email with Python? The use case I have is that each week, I have class that starts on the same days at the same time. About an hour before class, I send a reminder email to the students that class will start soon and include the Zoom link for the class. This is a repedative task. There must be a way to automate this with Python.

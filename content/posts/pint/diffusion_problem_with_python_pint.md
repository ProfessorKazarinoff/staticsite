Summary: I was working on an engineering problem involving diffusion with involved a couple of different units including joules, grams, kilograms, meters, centimeters, moles, megapascals and weight percent. To make sure that I kept track of all the units and unit conversions throughout the problem, I thought I'd try using **pint**, a **Python** package for unit conversions.

Summary: This is the first part of a multi-part series on building a web app with Python and Django. The web app will act as a resource for Engineering students at Oregon Community Colleges that want to transfer to 4-year Universities. The transfer web app will show which classes from their community college engineering program will transfer to which classes in a 4-year University engineering program. In this first post, I'll review the motivation for the project and my initial idea of what the finished app will look like.

This is the first part of a series of posts about building an Internet of Things (IoT) server with **flask**, Python and ESP8266 microcontrollers. In this post we'll add a sqlite3 database to our IoT server so that we can store all the temperature data points that come in from our ESP8266-based WiFi weather stations. We will also use Python's **datetime** library to mark each datapoint with a time when it is stored.

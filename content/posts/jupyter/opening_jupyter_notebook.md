Summary: In this post, we will run through how to open a jupyter notebook on Windows 10.  Jupyter notebooks are one way engineers can write and execute Python code. Jupyter notebooks contain Python code, the output of that code produces when it is run and markdown cells to explain the code. A jupyter notebook can be started from the Anaconda Prompt, the Windows start menu and the jupyter dashboard.



## 3 ways to open a jupyter notebook:

1. use the **Anaconda Prompt**

2. use the Windows Start Menu

3. Use the jupyter dashboard



### 1. use the **Anaconda Prompt**

Go to the windows start menu and select [Anaconda Prompt] under [Anaconda3].

If you don't see the **Anaconda Prompt** in the Windows Start Menu, then you need to install **Anaconda**. Download **Anaconda** at the following link: [Anaconda.com/downloads](https://www.anaconda.com/download/)

The **Anaconda Prompt** window should look something like:

At the **Anaconda Prompt** type:

```
> jupyter notebook
```

This will start the jupyter notebook kernal. The output in the terminal will look something like below:

```

```

A web browser should open and you should be able to see the Jupyter file browser:

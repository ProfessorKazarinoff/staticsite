Summary: What exactly is the problem that needs to be solved with Fair Talk? Where and when does the problem take place and who does it effect?

## What is The Fair?

When I talk about _The Fair_, I mean [The Oregon Country Fair](http://www.oregoncountryfair.org/). The Oregon Country Fair is an annual event outside Eugene, Oregon that is attended by about 45,000 people each year. It is sort of like a renaissance festival, music festival and craft show all in one. The Fair is in the woods in Veneta, OR just outside the city of Eugene. There are open areas that contain about stages and activities connected with walking paths that are lined with booths on either side. In total there are about 1000 booths and 20 stages. 


## What is the Fair Talk Problem?

The problem is about 45,000 people all crammed into a one wooded area overwhelm the local cell phone network. If you try to text or call someone inside The Fair, the text is likely to be delayed hours (or even arrive a day late) and the voice call usually don't go through at all. Anything else that requires cell phone connectivity like google maps or browsing the internet doesn't usually work either. 

## Who does the Fair Talk Problem Effect?

The inability to text or call anyone inside The Fair is a problem for our family. My mother-in-law and two brothers-in-law stay on the fair grounds. My wife and kids stay with my father-in-law near The Fair, but off The Fair grounds. When we decide to meet our family somewhere in The Fair, everyone in the family has to be very specific about the time and meeting place. There is no way to change plans and let people inside The Fair know with a text or call until you see them face to face again. Texting just doesn't work reliably. 

## When is Fair Talk a Problem?

The cell phone network in Venita Oregon only gets overwhelmed during The Fair. This is just three days in mid-July. Although, in the week leading up to The Fair, the cell network is still often slow too.

## What are some of the Physical Constraints to the Fair Talk Problem?

There are a couple of physical constraints in the way of communicating with my extended family during The Fair. One is distance. It is approximately 1 mile between the campground in The Fair, and where my wife and I stay outside of The Fair. Another Physical constraint is trees. The Fair is in a forest and there are large douglas fir trees within The Fair grounds and surrounding the property. These fir trees can be 50 feet tall and spaced very close together. There is no direct line of site between where my wife and I stay outside the fair and the rest of the family stays in the fair. Think about the kind of forest you would find bigfoot in.  Another physical constraint is power. In The Fair, there aren't regular electrical power outlets hanging around. Charging cell phones can be a pain because there isn't anywhere to plug them in. Another constraint has to do with the phones themselves. Some people in the family have iphones and others have android phones. Cost is another limitation. The entire system of communication needs to less than $300. This is a self-imposed limit, but seems reasonable to me. 

## What are some resources available to solve the Fair Talk Problem?

There are a bunch of Physical constraints, but there are also some resources that can be used. There is power at my father-in-laws house where my wife and I stay. Regular 120V wall power. I can run a fairly long electrical cord to put that power anywhere in about a 50ft radius of my father-in-law;s shop. My father-in-law also has lots of space in his yard. There is about 5 acres of space. I don't think my father-in-law will be overly concerned with a big antenna in the lawn for three days. Inside The Fair, I think that I'll have the ability to mount something within the campgrounds.

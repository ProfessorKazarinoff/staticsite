So excited about publishing my first book! Pick it up here: [Link to Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07M7S6LTT/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&qid=1547223360&sr=8-5&keywords=kazarinoff) 

The book has been over a year in the making. Many long nights writing and revising. Without the support of my awesome wife, there is no way I would have been able to finish it. Thank-you sweetie - I love you!

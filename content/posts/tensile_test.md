Summary: In this post we will construct a stress-strain curve using Python, matplotlib and pandas. The plot was constructed in a jupyter notebook, but can be written in a regular python .py files as well. In addition to the overall stress strain curve we will also include and inset curve of the elastic region and minor tick mark Below is a .md post with the drop in jupyter notebook from the code folder that has a liquid tags added within the .md file.
